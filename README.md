# Flashcard Quiz App with Redux

This project is part of the Front End Engineer path on Codecademy. It serves as a challenge project where we apply the knowledge gained during the Redux section to create a flashcard-style quiz app using Redux and Redux Toolkit. The app enables users to create topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for the quizzes. Users can interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

For completion, the task involves implementing the app's Redux logic for creating and managing topics, quizzes, and cards. Codecademy provided boilerplate code for React Router, component rendering, and CSS styling.

## Features

- **Topic Management:** Users can create and manage topics.
- **Quiz Creation:** Users can create quizzes for topics and associate them accordingly.
- **Flashcard Addition:** Users can add flashcards to quizzes.
- **Interactive Quizzes:** Users can interact with quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

## Technologies Used To Complete Implementation
